## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation set built and verified against the code by a docs-health
  audit: TODO_LIST.md, FEATURES.md, ROADMAP.md and docs/DOMAIN_LANGUAGE.md.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-21

First public release.

### Added

- `services.telephony` NixOS module: extensions, ring groups, voicemail, call
  recording, RTP port range, TLS (self-signed or manual certificates), NAT
  address, firewall toggle — fully typed options with 8 configuration
  assertions.
- FreeSWITCH XML configuration generated from Nix options (no FusionPBX or
  FreePBX): sofia internal/external profiles, directory, dialplan (echo test
  `9196`, `*98` voicemail check, ring groups, toll-allow-gated E.164 routing),
  event socket bound to localhost with a configured password.
- Static SIP.js 0.21 WebRTC webphone (esbuild-bundled, no CDN) served by nginx
  behind `wss://<domain>/sip`, with the SIP.js MIT notice shipped next to the
  bundle.
- coturn STUN/TURN wiring, credentials delivered to the webphone via
  `config.js`.
- Optional ITSP gateway for international calls and inbound DIDs (null makes
  PSTN dialling answer 503).
- FreeSWITCH prompts and music-on-hold package.
- Example host (`hosts/pbx`) and ephemeral demo VM (`nix run .#vm`).
- NixOS VM test (`tests/pbx.nix`): sofia profiles, directory lookups, a real
  `originate` dialplan call, webphone and `config.js` over TLS, WSS proxy to
  sofia, coturn, recordings directory.
- flake-parts project layout: packages, VM app, checks (VM test, treefmt
  format, statix, deadnix) and a dev shell (treefmt wrapper, nil, jq).
- CI: GitHub Actions running `nix flake check` (with a KVM udev rule for the
  NixOS VM test); MIT `LICENSE`.

### Known limitations

- All secrets (extension, gateway, TURN, event-socket passwords) end up in the
  world-readable Nix store — wire a secret manager for exposed deployments.
- Emergency calling (911/112) is not wired.
- The webphone has not yet been validated with a real end-to-end browser call.
